OfficeCacheCleaner
==================

Cleanes the office 365 offline cache of old files.

Program that deletes all FSD and FSF files if they are older than X minutes (default 5). 
I had some trouble with backing 500GB of photos/videos from D: because the offline cache kept filling up my C: which runs on a SSD. Onedrive / Office 365, what can I say?

Update: Now running as a windows service, you'll find the installer under dist/

If you run into any problems report them here, otherwise this application is completed.
